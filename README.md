# How to Use

- Place TemplateValidation in a folder of your liking covered by the PATH variable. 
- the `templates.xml` extracted from anno (not included!) must be in the same folder

- in the folder of your modded assets.xml, you open CMD and run `TemplateValidation assets.xml`
- The tool will write template mismatches to `validator.log`

> The tool only validates full assets for now
